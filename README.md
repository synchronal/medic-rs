# Medic

Medic is a development workflow management tool. This project is a
re-implementation of [Elixir medic](https://github.com/synchronal/medic)
in Rust, with the intention that it can be installed as a set of
stand-alone binaries and scripts with minimal tool-chain dependencies.

## Status

TBD. This project is currently a work in progress, and is not ready for
general use.
